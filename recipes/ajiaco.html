<h2>Description</h2>
<p>>The autochthonous Ajiaco is a Santafereña soup based on chicken, capira, pastusa and criolla potatoes,</p> 
cobs and guasca, accompanied by milk cream and capers, rice and avocado.

Ajiaco is one of those dishes that you cannot miss on your visit to Colombia.
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small chicken breast without skin but with the bone (400 g)</li>
        <li>¼ pound Creole potato, peeled and sliced (125 g)
            ¼ pound pastusa potato, peeled and sliced (125 g)</li>
        <li>3 ears of corn, halved (380 g) </li>
        <li>1/2 bunch of guascas (13 g)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of MILK CREAM</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>bring it to medium heat and stir constantly, add to the pot: the cob, the bone-in chicken breast and the potatoes. Cook over high heat for 20 minutes or until the potato and breast are cooked.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken breast from the pot and let it cool a bit to shred it. Once you have shredded the chicken, add the guascas to the pot and let them cook for 5 more minutes or until the potato melts a little and thus the Ajiaco thickens more.</li>
        <li>Serve the Santafereño Ajiaco in 4 equal plates, add the shredded chicken on top, decorate with a spoonful of MILK CREAM</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Accompany it with avocado AND ENJOY</p>
